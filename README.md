# Defect-Dataset

Deep learning breakthrough stimulates new research trends in civil infrastructure inspection, whereas the lack of quality-guaranteed, human-annotated, free-of-charge, and publicly available defect datasets with sufficient amounts of data hinders the progress of deep learning in defect inspection. To boost research in deep learning-based defect inspection, we review and summarizes 40 publicly available defect datasets, covering common defects in various types of buildings and infrastructures. The taxonomy of the datasets is proposed based on specific deep learning objectives (classification, segmentation, and detection). Clarifications are also made for each dataset regarding its corresponding data volume, data resolution, data source, defect categories covered, infrastructure types focused, material types targeted, algorithms adopted for validation, annotation levels, and context levels.
